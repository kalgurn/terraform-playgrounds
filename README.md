# terraform-playgrounds
Repo with tf roles I am using for testing stuffs

Consists of three folders:
- [modules](modules)
- [metamodules](metamodules)
- [playgrounds](playgrounds)

The _modules_ folder, well, it consists of a variety modules I am using for testing.

The _metamodules_ folder is a rough definition of a result I want to achieve

The _playgrounds_ folder will be mostly a value definitions for the metamodules.
